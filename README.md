# E-Commerce Backend API

## 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## üìù Description

The E-Commerce Backend API is a robust server-side application that empowers e-commerce platforms with a dynamic and scalable database management system. Built with Node.js, Sequelize ORM, and MySQL, this application provides essential API endpoints for managing product catalogs, including departments, products, and tags. It facilitates seamless CRUD operations, enabling front-end developers to effortlessly interact with back-end data for e-commerce solutions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change into the project directory.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Execute `npm install` to install required dependencies.
4. **Database Setup**: Initialize your MySQL database using the provided `schema.sql` in the `db` directory. Optionally, seed the database with initial data from `seeds` directory by running `npm run seed`.
5. **Environment Configuration**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your database name (`DB_NAME`), user (`DB_USER`), and password (`DB_PASSWORD`).
6. **Launch the Server**: Start the application server using `npm start`. Ensure you have MySQL running.

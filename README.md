# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This E-Commerce Backend API is a powerful, simple-to-use back-end system designed specifically for e-commerce applications. Utilizing MySQL for database management, it provides a robust platform for front-end developers to interact with and manipulate e-commerce related data effectively. Through the development of this project, I have gained deeper insights into back-end database systems and architecture, enhancing my skills in creating scalable and efficient back-end solutions.

## Features

- **Sequelize ORM**: Simplifies MySQL database interactions using a high-level abstraction.
- **ExpressJS Framework**: Offers a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **NodeJS Environment**: Executes JavaScript code server-side, providing a full-stack development capability.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods for comprehensive data management.

## Installation

1. **NodeJS Requirement**: Ensure NodeJS is installed on your system. [Download NodeJS here](https://nodejs.org/en) if needed.
2. **Repository Setup**: Clone this GitHub repository or download the ZIP. Extract (if needed) and navigate to the project directory.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal in the project directory and execute `npm i` to install required npm packages.
4. **Database Configuration**: Ensure the `ecommerce_db` schema is set up in your MySQL database. [MySQL schema setup guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html).
5. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory for database configurations: `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, & `DB_PASSWORD`. [Learn about .env files](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs/).
6. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` to initiate the server. **Note:** Testing the API endpoints via an application like Insomnia is recommended.
7. **Seed Database (Optional)**: To populate your database with starter data, run `npm run seed` in your terminal.
